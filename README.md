# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to predict food delivery times, a critical aspect of the food delivery industry. Accurate and timely predictions help improve customer satisfaction and streamline operations.

## Overview

The project workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free from errors and inconsistencies to provide a reliable foundation for predictions.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and analyzing key variables such as:
   - Delivery personnel's age
   - Customer ratings
   - Geographic coordinates
   - Time-based factors
3. **Model Development**: Leveraging regression algorithms, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forests
   - XGBoost
4. **Model Validation**: Utilizing cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's reliability and generalizability.
